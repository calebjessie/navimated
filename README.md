Navimated
==============
By Caleb Jessie

A simple collapsed navigation that's animated to delight users.

Author notes
-------------------------

I plan to add responsiveness to the navigation states and also have more navs to add a variety of animation styles.

P.S., Even though this is for practice, I'd love to hear any thoughts about my code and how I could improve.
